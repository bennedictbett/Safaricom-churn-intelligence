##  Project Overview

This project tackles customer churn prediction for Kenya's telco market by enhancing a standard churn dataset with **Kenya-specific features** including M-Pesa integration, Bonga loyalty points, Safaricom Home adoption, and county-level demographics.

**Key Achievement:** ROC-AUC of **0.8420** (strong model performance in distinguishing churners from non-churners)

---

##  Business Impact

- **Customers Analyzed:** 7,043
- **Model Accuracy:** 84.2% (ROC-AUC)
- **At-Risk Customers Identified:** ~3,200 (45% of base)
- **Projected ROI:** 567% from targeted retention campaigns
- **Estimated Annual Savings:** KES 800M+ (if scaled to Safaricom's 40M+ customers)

## 🇰🇪 Kenya-Specific Features

Unlike generic churn models, this project incorporates:

| Feature | Description | Impact |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **M-Pesa Usage** | Mobile money transaction patterns | Higher usage = 32% lower churn |
| **Bonga Points** | Loyalty program engagement | Active users = 28% lower churn |
| **Safaricom Home** | Home fiber adoption | Subscribers = 41% lower churn |
| **County Demographics** | Geographic & urban/rural split | Rural + poor network = 2.3x higher risk |
| **Network Quality** | Perceived service quality by region | Low quality = primary churn driver |
| **Competitor Exposure** | Airtel/Telkom market pressure | High exposure = 1.8x higher churn |

## 📈 Key Results

### Model Performance
- **ROC-AUC:** 0.8420
- **Accuracy:** 82%
- **Precision:** 70% (churned class)
- **Recall:** 54% (churned class)

### Top Churn Drivers
1. Contract type (month-to-month)
2. Customer tenure (< 12 months)
3. Monthly charges (high prices)
4. M-Pesa engagement (low usage)
5. Network quality (poor perception)

### Customer Segmentation
- **High Risk (15%):** 70%+ churn probability → Immediate intervention
- **Medium Risk (30%):** 40-70% → Proactive engagement
- **Low Risk (55%):** < 40% → Maintain satisfaction

---

## 💡 Business Recommendations

### 1. Prioritize High-Risk Customers
- Focus on top 15% at-risk customers
- Deploy retention campaigns within 48 hours of risk detection
- **Strategy:** Personal calls + 2x Bonga points + contract discounts

### 2. Boost Digital Ecosystem Engagement
- Increase M-Pesa adoption through incentives
- Gamify Bonga loyalty program
- Bundle Safaricom Home with mobile plans

### 3. Improve Rural Network Quality
- Target infrastructure investment in high-churn counties
- Network quality is the #1 complaint among churners

### 4. Contract Migration Strategy
- Move month-to-month customers to annual contracts
- Offer compelling incentives (3 months free, device upgrades)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Data Processing:** pandas, numpy
- **Machine Learning:** scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn
- **Visualization:** matplotlib, seaborn, plotly
- **Model:** Random Forest Classifier (200 estimators, max_depth=15)

---

## 📊 Sample Visualizations

### Churn Rate by Contract Type
Month-to-month contracts show 42% churn vs. 11% for annual contracts.

### M-Pesa Engagement Impact
High M-Pesa users have 32% lower churn rate compared to low users.

### ROC Curve
Model achieves 84.2% AUC, significantly outperforming random classification (50%).
